    "In combination with advances in machine learning, particularly deep learning, modern MARL has produced spectacular successes in high-dimensional environments. \n",

    "**CRLD** offers a solution in two ways of idealization.\n",
    "First, CRLD aims to understand the principles behind collective behavior in idealized, low-dimensional environments. Second, CRLD concentrates on the essence of the stochastic and computationally intense reinforcement learning algorithms by deriving their strategy-average, deterministic learning equations. \n",
